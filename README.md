# odin-recipes
First Odin project

Live Project: https://kd0ve.github.io/odin-recipes/

This project was to work on the foundational aspects of html that are learned in the first section of The Odin Project.

I had fun working on this project and I'm excited for many more to come! I look forward to seeing my progress from here onward.
