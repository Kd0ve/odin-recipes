    <p>Nice and easy clam chowder recipe that anyone can make</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 slices bacon, diced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>Â½ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable stock</li>
        <li>2 (6.5-ounce) cans chopped clams, juices reserved</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>2 russet potatoes, peeled and diced</li>
        <li>1 cup half and half*</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium high heat. Add bacon and cook until 
            brown and crispy, about 6-8 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate, reserving 
            1 tablespoon excess fat in the stockpot.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in the stockpot. Add garlic and onion, and cook, stirring frequently, until 
            onions have become translucent, about 2-3 minutes. Stir in thyme until fragrant, about 
            1 minute.</li>
        <li>Whisk in flour until lightly browned, about 1 minute. Gradually whisk in milk, vegetable 
            stock, clam juice and bay leaf, and cook, whisking constantly, until slightly thickened, 
            about 1-2 minutes. Stir in potatoes.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 12-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in half and half and clams until heated through, about 1-2 minutes; season with salt 
            and pepper, to taste. If the soup is too thick, add more half and half as needed until 
            desired consistency is reached.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately, garnished with bacon and parsley, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
